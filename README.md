## Day-52---Text-Analysis-and-Natural-Language-Processing-with-NLTK

As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python deals with text analysis and natural language processing with NLTK

**Text Analysis**
Text analysis involves extracting meaningful information, patterns, and insights from textual data. It is commonly used in areas like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, topic modeling, and text summarization. 

Text analysis is crucial in various applications such as:

**Search Engines:** Analyzing user queries and retrieving relevant results.
**Social Media:** Sentiment analysis of posts or comments.
**Customer Feedback:** Understanding customer sentiments and themes in surveys or reviews.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP applications include machine translation, chatbots, spam detection, and more.

**Using NLTK in Python for NLP**
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library in Python used for text analysis and NLP. It provides tools for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parsing, and more.
